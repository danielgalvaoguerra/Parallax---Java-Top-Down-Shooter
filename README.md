# Prallax---Java-Top-Down-Shooter

Top-down shooter game I made in Java in the summer of 2015
Interesting concepts used in this project:
  - Multi-threading
  - Data structures (ArrayLists mainly)
  - Inheritance
Art was produced by myself and my brother, Rafael Galvao Guerra

The song played is an mp3 file of the song "Logic Bomb" by The Algorithm - I do not own rights to the song
